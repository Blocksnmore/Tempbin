# Tempbin
Tempbin is a simple open sourced paste service designed for running on platforms like replit

# Use:
To use tempbin go to the website [Here](https://Tempbin.blocksnmore.repl.co) and create a paste like you would on pastebin. <br>
Once the paste is created it will stay for 1 week before it is auto removed.

# Hosting:
If you are hosting on a service like replit all you need to do is fork the repo and run it. <br>
If you plan to run this on a diffrent service you will need to modify the source to use a service like mysql.
